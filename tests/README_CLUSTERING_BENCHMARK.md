# Clustering Benchmark - GPT-4o vs K-means vs No Clustering

## What This Tests

This benchmark **proves** whether GPT-4o semantic clustering improves multi-hop reasoning compared to traditional k-means or no clustering.

### Three Approaches Compared

| Approach | How It Works | Cost | Expected Accuracy |
|----------|--------------|------|-------------------|
| **No Clustering** | Current retrieval (Qwen3 + SPLADE) | FREE | 90-92% |
| **K-means** | Groups by embedding similarity only | FREE | 85-88% |
| **GPT-4o-mini** | Intelligent semantic grouping | ~$0.005/conversation | 94-96% |

## Key Metrics

### 1. Semantic Similarity
How close is the response to full-context baseline?
- Target: ≥92% for production

### 2. Multi-Hop Accuracy
Does the response include ALL required context pieces?
- Example: Japan trip needs ["Tokyo", "Kyoto", "student budget", "3-4 days"]
- Target: ≥90% (6/7 terms found)

### 3. Response Differentiation
How different are responses between methods?
- Small differences (>95% similar) = clustering doesn't matter
- Large differences (<85% similar) = clustering significantly affects output

### 4. Latency
- No clustering: ~35ms retrieval
- K-means: ~20ms (clustering) + ~12ms (retrieval) = 32ms
- GPT-4o: ~150ms (clustering, cached later) + ~8ms (retrieval) = 158ms first time, ~8ms subsequent

### 5. Cost
- No clustering: $0.00
- K-means: $0.00
- GPT-4o: $0.005 per clustering (amortized over ~50 queries = $0.0001/query)

## Interpreting Results

### When GPT-4o Clustering Wins

If you see:
- **Semantic similarity** 3%+ higher than k-means
- **Multi-hop accuracy** 10%+ higher than k-means
- **Response differentiation** shows substantially different answers

→ **GPT-4o clustering significantly improves quality**

### When K-means is Sufficient

If you see:
- Semantic similarity within 2% of GPT-4o
- Multi-hop accuracy similar
- Small differences in responses

→ **Save money, use k-means**

### Example Winning Scenario for GPT-4o

```
Query: "Create 5-day itinerary fitting my budget and interests"

K-means clusters:
- Cluster 1: [turns 1,2,8,11] (random, broke logical chain)
- Missing: "student budget" was in different cluster

GPT-4o clusters:
- Cluster 1: "Trip Planning" [turns 1-6] (Tokyo, Kyoto, architecture, duration)
- Cluster 2: "Budget & Practical" [turns 7-10] (student budget, discounts, packing)

Result: GPT-4o found ALL dependencies, k-means missed 2/7 terms
```

## Cost Analysis

### Per-Conversation Clustering Cost

```
GPT-4o-mini pricing:
- Input: $0.15 / 1M tokens
- Output: $0.60 / 1M tokens

For 50-turn conversation:
- Input: ~5,000 tokens (conversation + prompt)
- Output: ~500 tokens (cluster assignments)
- Cost: (5000 × $0.15 + 500 × $0.60) / 1M = $0.0045
```

### Amortized Per-Query Cost

Clusters are cached and reused:
- Cluster once: $0.0045
- Use for 50 queries: $0.0001 per query
- **Negligible cost at scale**

### Break-Even Analysis

| Scenario | No Clustering Cost | GPT-4o Cost | Break-Even |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|------------|
| 10 queries | $0.00 | $0.0046 | Never (too few queries) |
| 50 queries | $0.00 | $0.0050 | Pays off if accuracy matters |
| 100 queries | $0.00 | $0.0055 | **$0.00005/query** |

**Conclusion:** For conversations with 20+ queries, GPT-4o clustering costs almost nothing per query.

## Next Steps

1. **Run the benchmark** to get actual numbers
2. **Compare results** - does GPT-4o beat k-means by 5%+?
3. **Use for marketing** - include benchmark results in README/docs
4. **Implement in production** - add clustering to enhanced_memory_manager.py

## Troubleshooting

### "OpenAI API key required"
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

### "Qdrant connection failed"
Check Qdrant is running:
```bash
# Local
docker ps | grep qdrant

# Cloud
curl -X GET "https://your-cluster.cloud.qdrant.io/health" \
  -H "api-key: your-key"
```

### "Out of GPU memory"
Reduce batch size or use smaller model:
```bash
python clustering_benchmark.py --model "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1"
```

### Results show k-means better than GPT-4o
This means:
- Conversation is too short (< 20 turns)
- No complex multi-hop reasoning needed
- K-means embedding similarity sufficient
- **Recommendation:** Use k-means to save cost
